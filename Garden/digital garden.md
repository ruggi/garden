This is my attempt at growing and tending to a digital garden.

The pages are written in plain text (with Markdown) and managed mostly with [[Obsidian]]. The source code is available [on Github](https://github.com/ruggi/garden/tree/main/Garden).

The Obsidian vault is rendered to HTML for easier consulting thanks to a tiny [[Go]] program ([link](https://github.com/ruggi/garden/blob/main/main.go)).
